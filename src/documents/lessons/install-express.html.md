title: Installing Express
---

In this lesson, you will be installing [Express](http://expressjs.com), a "web application framework for node". To do this, you will be installing the `express` module globally via `npm`. To do this, you will need a terminal or command line.

From your terminal, navigate to a directory you would like to use to install your application. This may be your Downloads or My Documents folder, your Desktop, a Dropbox folder, a webroot folder, or anywhere you are comfortable navigating to and creating new files.

**The location doesn't matter for our purposes, so anywhere you are comfortable with**.

The easiest way to install `express` is to follow the [installation section](http://expressjs.com/guide.html#executable) of the documentation, so follow along there. Running the install command will take a little bit of time, just be patient.

> If you're on Linux or Mac, you will likely need to put `sudo` before that command and enter your password when asked, since the `global` (note the `-g` flag) install will need to write files to places your normal account doesn't have access to.

Once complete, run `express --help` to verify that everything is working. Don't run any of the other commands or worry about going further in the documentation yet. When you have Express installed, you can move on to the next lesson.
