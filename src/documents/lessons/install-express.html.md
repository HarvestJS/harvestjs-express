# Installing express

In this lesson, you will be installing [Express](http://expressjs.com), a "web application framework for node". To do this, you will be installing the `express` module globally via `npm`. To do this, you will need a terminal or command line.

From your terminal, navigate to a directory you would like to use to install your application. This may be your Downloads or My Documents folder, your Desktop, a Dropbox folder, a webroot folder, or anywhere you are comfortable navigating to and creating new files.

**The location doesn't matter for our purposes, so anywhere you are comfortable with**.

<hr>

The easiest way to install `express` is to follow the [installation section](http://expressjs.com/guide.html#executable) of the documentation. Follow along there, and once installed, feel free to run `express --help` to verify that everything is working.

Don't run any of the other command yet. When you have Express installed, you can move on to the next lesson.
