# Creating an Express Project

For this project, you will be installing express with `ejs`, `session` and `css` support.

Install the project to the `harvest` path. If you need help with the commands for using our desired options, run `express --help` again.

<hr>

You should now have a directory named `harvest`. Navigate into that directory and see what express has created for us.

Now would also be a good time to open up your editor of choice in this new directory. If you don't have an editor you like to use, feel free to install [SublimeText](http://www.sublimetext.com/2).

Open up the `app.js` in your editor. This is the file that will be used to bootstrap and launch your new express web application.

Don't worry about understanding everything that is happening just yet, just take a peek. When you are ready, move on to the next lesson.
