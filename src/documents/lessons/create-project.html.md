It's time to create your first project. Jump back to the [installation section](http://expressjs.com/guide.html#executable) of the documentation and go down to the part that reads *If you want to generate an application...*

For this project, you will be installing express in the `harvest` path with `ejs` and `session` support, but not `stylus` support, so leave off the `--css stylus` part. If you need help with the commands for installing these options, run `express --help` again. That's as much of the documentation that we need to use for now.

You should now have a directory named `harvest`. Navigate into that directory in the terminal and see what express has created for you by running `cd harvest` and `dir` from Windows or `ls` from Linux or Mac.

Now would also be a good time to open up your editor of choice in this new directory. If you don't have an editor you like to use, feel free to install [SublimeText](http://www.sublimetext.com/2).

<hr>

Open up the `app.js` file in your editor. This is the file that will be used to bootstrap and launch your new express web application. Don't worry about understanding what is happening just yet, just take a peek.

When you are ready, move on to the next lesson.
